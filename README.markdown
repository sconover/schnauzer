This is a small ruby wrapper around the cocoa api - no daemons to manage.  It's also really fast.

You'll need to install RubyCocoa, located here: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubycocoa/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubycocoa/files/), or you can use install_rubycocoa.rb, located in the root of the project.

Replace this readme with something better one day.
